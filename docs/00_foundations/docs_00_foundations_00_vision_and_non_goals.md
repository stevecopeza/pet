# PET (Plan. Execute. Track)
## Vision and Non‑Goals

### Purpose
PET exists to be the **operational truth system** for a professional services business that sells software, hardware, and time. It is designed to expose reality — not to mask it — by making work, promises, and outcomes measurable by default.

PET is **measurement‑first**. If something cannot be measured, reconciled to time, or tied to an obligation, it is treated as incomplete.

### Vision
PET enables a business like RPM Resources to:

- Understand **what was promised**, **what was sold**, **what was delivered**, and **what actually happened**
- See operational health through **leading indicators**, not lagging reports
- Align sales, delivery, support, and finance around a **single operational model**
- Improve performance through **structural feedback**, not anecdotal reporting

### Core Outcomes
When PET is working correctly:

- Every quote becomes a measurable obligation
- Every project reconciles sold vs delivered time
- Every support interaction is contextual and attributable
- Every KPI is derived from facts, not opinion
- Managers influence outcomes by shaping inputs, not rewriting history

### Explicit Non‑Goals
PET deliberately does **not** attempt to:

- Be a generic CRM for arbitrary industries
- Replace accounting systems (e.g. QuickBooks)
- Optimise for extreme configurability at the cost of safety
- Allow silent mutation of historical data
- Hide operational inefficiencies behind dashboards

### Design Biases
The system intentionally biases toward:

- Auditability over convenience
- Immutability over editability
- Explicit trade‑offs over implicit behaviour
- Structural correctness over UI polish (initially)

### Target User Reality
PET assumes:

- Complex, overlapping roles (sales, PM, engineer, support)
- Long‑running customer relationships
- Concurrent projects and support obligations
- Fixed‑fee and time‑based revenue co‑existing
- Management decisions based on partial, noisy data

PET exists to reduce that noise by design.
