# PET – Commercial Adjustments & Concessions

## Purpose
Defines how PET records **intentional commercial decisions** such as write-offs, credits, and goodwill concessions without corrupting operational truth.

---

## Core Principle

Commercial concessions are **explicit business decisions**, not corrections of history.

---

## Adjustment Types

- Write-off (non-billable time or scope)
- Service credit
- Discount post-acceptance
- Goodwill support

---

## Model

- Adjustments are first-class entities
- Linked to Quote, Project, SLA, or Invoice Intent
- Require approval
- Emit domain events

---

## KPI Impact

- Adjustments are visible in margin KPIs
- Classified as intentional loss, not failure

---

**Authority**: Normative
