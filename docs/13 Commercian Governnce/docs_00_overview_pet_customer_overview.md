# PET (Plan. Execute. Track)
## Customer Overview

## What PET Is

**PET (Plan. Execute. Track)** is an integrated business operations platform designed for organisations that sell and deliver **software, hardware, projects, and support services**.

PET provides a **single operational truth** across sales, delivery, support, finance, and people — ensuring that what is promised, delivered, and measured always aligns.

It is built specifically to support **consulting‑led, project‑driven businesses** such as RPM Resources and their customers.

---

## The Problem PET Solves

Most service businesses struggle with:

- Disconnected systems (CRM, projects, timesheets, support, finance)
- Manual reconciliation between sales promises and delivery reality
- Poor visibility into utilisation, margins, and risk
- KPIs that cannot be trusted or explained
- Operational knowledge living in people’s heads

PET addresses these issues by **design**, not by reporting after the fact.

---

## Core Philosophy

PET is built on three simple principles:

1. **Plan** – Clearly define what will be delivered, by whom, and at what cost
2. **Execute** – Deliver work in a controlled, transparent way
3. **Track** – Measure reality continuously and honestly

Nothing in PET is hidden, overwritten, or silently corrected.

## What Makes PET Different

### One Version of the Truth
PET does not allow multiple systems to disagree quietly. When discrepancies occur, they are surfaced and resolved explicitly.

### Built for Accountability
Once something is agreed or delivered, it cannot be edited away. Corrections are visible and auditable.

### Designed for Measurement
KPIs are not an afterthought. They are built into the system from day one and can always be explained.

### Flexible Where It Matters
Customer data, leads, projects, and support tickets support **malleable fields**, allowing the system to adapt without breaking history.

## How PET Fits Into Your Business

PET integrates with your existing environment rather than replacing everything:

- Financial systems (e.g. accounting and invoicing)
- Communication channels (email, messaging)
- ERP context (such as SYSPRO identifiers)

PET remains the **operational authority**, while external systems perform their specialised roles.

---

## What You Gain

With PET in place, you gain:

- Confidence that sales promises are deliverable
- Early warning of project and support risk
- Reliable utilisation and margin insight
- Reduced reliance on spreadsheets and tribal knowledge
- A system that improves over time, rather than decaying

---

## Who PET Is For

PET is designed for organisations that:

- Deliver complex projects and ongoing services
- Care about accountability and measurement
- Want operational clarity, not just reports
- Are prepared to run the business on facts

---

## Summary

PET is not just another system. It is an **operating model** for service‑led businesses.

By tightly linking planning, execution, and tracking, PET enables better decisions, stronger delivery, and long‑term operational maturity.
