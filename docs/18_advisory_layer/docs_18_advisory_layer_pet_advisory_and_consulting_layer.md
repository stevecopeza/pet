# PET – Advisory & Consulting Layer

## Purpose of this Document
This document defines the **PET Advisory & Consulting Layer**: how operational truth captured by PET is deliberately transformed into **consulting insight, customer value, and strategic conversations**.

This layer is not a new system. It is a **structured way of using PET’s data to elevate RPM’s role** from implementer to trusted advisor.

---

## Core Principle

PET Advisory outputs:
- Are **derived**, never edited
- Do **not** change operational truth
- Exist to support *decisions and conversations*, not execution

Operational systems run the business. Advisory outputs explain the business.

---

## Why This Layer Exists

Without an advisory layer:
- PET risks being seen as "just another system"
- Customers see data, but not meaning
- Consulting value remains implicit and manual

With this layer:
- PET becomes a **consulting accelerator**
- RPM monetises insight, not just hours
- Customers understand *why* things happened, not just *what*

---

## Advisory Audience Types

### 1. Executive Stakeholders (Customer Side)

Concerns:
- Is the investment paying off?
- Where is risk building?
- Are we improving over time?

---

### 2. Operational Managers (Customer Side)

Concerns:
- Why are projects overrunning?
- Where are bottlenecks?
- What should we fix first?

---

### 3. RPM Account & Consulting Teams

Concerns:
- Where to add value next
- Which customers are drifting
- Where advisory intervention is justified

---

## Advisory Output Types

### 1. Quarterly Business Review (QBR) Packs

Derived from:
- Project delivery KPIs
- SLA performance
- Utilisation vs capacity
- Commercial adjustments

Characteristics:
- Time-bound snapshots
- Trend-focused
- Explain variance and decisions

---

### 2. Delivery Maturity Assessments

Assesses:
- Estimate accuracy
- Variance frequency
- Change management discipline

Outcome:
- Maturity score over time
- Clear improvement areas

---

### 3. Support & Reliability Reviews

Assesses:
- Ticket volume trends
- SLA breaches and causes
- Recurring issue patterns

Outcome:
- Root cause visibility
- Preventative recommendations

---

### 4. Financial & Commercial Health Narratives

Assesses:
- Write-offs and concessions
- Recurring vs project revenue stability
- Support cost vs entitlement

Outcome:
- Explicit commercial conversations
- Reduced surprises

---

## Advisory Mechanics

### Data Sources

Advisory views draw from:
- Immutable domain events
- KPI definitions
- Commercial adjustment records

No advisory output modifies source data.

---

### Generation Model

Advisory outputs:
- Are generated on demand
- Are versioned
- May be annotated (notes, commentary)

Annotations are separate from operational records.

---

## Boundaries and Safeguards

Advisory layer must never:
- Mask operational failure
- Recalculate KPIs differently
- Override delivery or support truth

Advisory outputs may:
- Reframe data
- Group insights
- Highlight patterns

---

## Security and Visibility

Rules:
- Advisory outputs are role-restricted
- Customer-facing views are explicitly curated
- Internal advisory notes are never customer-visible

---

## Consulting Triggers

PET can surface advisory opportunities when:
- Variance repeats beyond threshold
- SLA breaches show systemic causes
- Capability risk emerges
- Commercial concessions exceed norms

These triggers prompt **human consulting action**, not automation.

---

## What This Enables for RPM

- Structured QBR delivery
- Fact-based advisory conversations
- Premium consulting justification
- Clear differentiation from competitors

PET becomes part of the consulting *methodology*, not just tooling.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not predictive AI (by default)
- Not automated decision-making
- Not customer self-diagnosis tooling

Judgement remains human. PET provides clarity.

---

**Authority**: Normative

This document defines how PET underpins RPM’s advisory and consulting value.
